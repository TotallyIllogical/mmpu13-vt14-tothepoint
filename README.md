This is a site where you can search for a movie and see the different scores the movie has gotten on different moviedatabasess. 
We used jquery, javascript, html and css with Foundation Zurb's framwork to make the site.

We are two students of the collage Teknikhögskolan located in Malmö, and this was an assignment where we had to come up and make a site using what we learned so far.
