======================

This is a site where you can search for a movie and see the different scores the movie has gotten on different moviedatabasess. 
We used jquery, javascript, html and css with Foundation Zurb's framwork to make the site.

We who made this are two students from Teknikhögskolan located in Malmö. This was an assignment where we had to use what we learned so far to come up with a site and make it.
